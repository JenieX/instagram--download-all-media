- [Only One download session is allowed](#one-download-session)
- [Download session will start in a new popup window](#download-session-popup)
- [Download window should not be minimized](#download-session-window)

### Experimental
Instagram tends to make changes frequently, meaning this user script could break any time.

### One Download Session
In order to lower the chance of being detected as a spam.

### Download Session Popup
In order for the download window to show up, you may need to allow it, as it is a `POPUP`.

### Download session window 
Should not be minimized. Otherwise, the download session will be paused, and resumes after maximizing the window.

### Download Delay
To simulate normal usage thus lower the chance of being detected as a spam.
