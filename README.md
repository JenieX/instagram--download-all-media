# instagram--download-all-media
User Script that allows you to download all user media.

## Browser Download Settings (screenshot)
- Disable `Ask me what to do with each download`, to save media without showing any dialog.
- Set the `Location` folder to some folder like `D:\instagram-downloads`

## Notes
- [This is an experimental user script](#experimental)
- [Only One download session is allowed](#one-download-session)
- [Download session will start in a new popup window](#download-session-popup)
- [Download window should not be minimized](#no-minimized-download-window)
- [Three seconds delay between each download](#download-delay)

## Why?

### Experimental
Instagram tends to make changes frequently, meaning this user script could break any time.

### One Download Session
In order to lower the chance of being detected as a spam.

### Download Session Popup
It is related to how Instagram works. And in order for the download window to show up, you may need to allow it, as it is a `POPUP`.

### No Minimized Download window 
It is related to how Instagram works. And if the window is minimized, the download session will be paused. It will automatically resume download after maximizing the window though.

### Download Delay
To simulate normal usage thus lower the chance of being detected as a spam.
