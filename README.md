## Important Notes
- [This is an experimental user script](#experimental)
- [Only One download session is allowed](#one-download-session)
- [Download session will start in a new popup window](#download-session-popup)
- [Download window should not be minimized](#no-minimized-download-window)
- [Three seconds delay between each download](#download-delay)

## Why?

### Experimental
Instagram tends to make changes frequently, meaning this user script could break any time.

### One Download Session
In order to lower the chance of being detected as a spam.

### Download Session Popup
It is related to how Instagram works. In order for the download window to show up, you may need to allow it, as it is a `POPUP`.

### No Minimized Download window 
It is related to how Instagram works. If the window is minimized, the download session will be paused. It will resume download after maximizing the window though.

### Download Delay
To simulate normal usage thus lower the chance of being detected as a spam.
